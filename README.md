## 🚀 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer and cybersecurity professional who bridges the gap between secure coding practices and threat analysis. Currently pursuing my Computer Science degree at MSU Denver (graduating Spring 2026), I build robust applications while maintaining a security-first mindset.

- 🔭 Currently working on **New Project, To Be Announced!** (Flask web application)
- 🎨 Also working on **New Project, To Be Announced!** (MERN web application)
- 🌱 Learning **Web Application Security & Intermediate Penetration Testing**
- 🏆 Cybersecurity Competitions I've Competed In: **MWCC 2023/2024, RMCDCC 2025**
- 💼 Working at **The Sustainability Hub** an NSF-funded program to make environmental data more accessible to people through a specialized RAG-chatbot on a user-friendly web app
<!-- - 🎯 Goal: **DevSecOps Engineer → Penetration Tester → Red Team** -->
